_The Ultimate Bounty Platform_

## 🎯 What Is It?

**Most Wanted** is a fun, competitive social app where you and your friends can place “bounties” on one another (in good spirit), nominate targets, and see who climbs the leaderboard.  
Think of it as a playful way to settle scores, spar in jest, or just push your squad’s competitive edge.

Key features include:

- **Private Rooms** – Only those you invite (via code) can join your bounty game.
- **Unlimited Targets** – Nominate anyone — friends, foes, co-workers — the more creative, the better.
- **Live Leaderboards** – Watch rankings update in real time as bounties change and climbs happen.
- **Stackable Bounties** – Multiple people can pile on points or “votes” toward a target.

## 🧩 How It Works

Getting started is quick — here’s the flow:

1. **Create a Room**  
   Spin up a private room with a coded invite. Share with your group.
2. **Nominate Targets**  
   Add your victims (I mean, _friends_) to the bounty board.
3. **Place Bounties / Votes**  
   Cast votes, stack points, and watch as targets rise up in the “Most Wanted” ranks.

## Why You’ll Love It

1. Great for social circles, classes, gaming groups — introduces lighthearted competition.

2. Private rooms ensure your “targets” can’t see inside unless invited.

3. Real-time leaderboards constantly shift — tension builds.

4. It’s simple, but creative — open for expansions: reward systems, timers, penalty bounties, etc.

## Future Ideas & Roadmap

1. Integrate real-time WebSockets so updates are instant

2. Add timer-based bounties (e.g. double points for the first hour)

3. Allow redeeming points / spending them on perks (memes, messages, etc.)

4. User profiles / avatars / badges

5. Notifications / push alerts when someone places a bounty on you

6. Moderation / safety (prevent abuse)
